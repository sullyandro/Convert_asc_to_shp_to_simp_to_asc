# Routine to convert asc (lon,lat) to shapefile, simplify, and convert again to asc

<br/>

## Convert the asc file to a shapefile file - in two forms (shape of points and a polygon)

## Then simplify the shapefile to have fewer vertices (this makes area mean routines run faster) and save it again as asc file
